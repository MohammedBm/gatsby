This is how easy it is to start a new blog built with Gatsby and host it on Netlify.
It is a bit complcated to start working on react at the begining but you will get the hang of it soon enough
From what i started, i think react create a template of html files and use these template. So i don't need to write or hardcode the same
files over and over again. instead i can use files like theses and write without worrying about the tags and missing syntax
